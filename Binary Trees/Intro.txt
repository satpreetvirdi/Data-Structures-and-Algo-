Tree Data Structure:
1. Used to store data in a hierarchical manner. 
2. Example: File Explorer uses it maintain Folder & file structure in computer, DOM in HTML, comments
3. Can have any number of children

Basic Terminology:
Root - Topmost node of the tree 
Parent - A node having successor is a parent of that node 
Child - A node having ancestor is a child of that node 
Sibling - nodes of same parent
Leaf Node - Node which doesn't have any children

Binary Tree:
A tree where each node can have maximum two child

Properties of Binary Tree:
1. Maximum nodes at level L : 2^L
2. Maximum nodes in a tree of height H: *2^H-1*, where H is the number of levels
3. For N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of levels are log2(N+1)
4. A binary tree with L leaves has at least log2(N+1)+1 number of levels
